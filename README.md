# Welcome!

Welcome to FRC Team 937's programming documentation! As with the rest of this documentation, it is here to serve as documentation for any programming-related things that can be publicly facing.&#x20;

If you're a team member, you should have access to the programming Google Drive folder. If you don't, talk to the club sponsor (Mr. Fagan, as of 2022). It contains several things, mostly programming documentation that can't be publicly facing, for one reason or another. It can be found here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10QRKKeGyF1wYfXASNeiSQ5QV-CVRaIki](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10QRKKeGyF1wYfXASNeiSQ5QV-CVRaIki)&#x20;

We hope this can be of some use. Thanks,

FRC Team 937
