# Intro

Welcome to "programming boot camp!" (As I'm tentatively calling it.) This section of programming documentation is intended as both curriculum for use in teaching new programmers, well, how to program, and as a reference for when said programmers (both new and old) forget the basicsâ€”we all do sometimes.

We'll start with the very basics of the Java language, then move to some basic concepts of robotics programming with some specifics of WPILib (the library we use to program robots in FRC), and we'll finish off by covering command-based programming, the specific paradigm we use within WPILib.

As a note to all new programmers: **Ask. Freaking. Questions.** The best way to learn about programming is to try it, get confused, and then google it or ask someone who knows more about the language you're working with. Questions, no matter how stupid they may seem, aren't bad by any stretch of the imagination, they're how we learn.

I may convert this into a PowerPoint (or a few PowerPoints) to use to teach this in a classroom-like manner. If I do, I will link them here.
