# Build Season Schedule

This is a rough schedule of what build season should look like. It's gonna look fast, but that's just how FRC is. You won't believe how much you can get done working as many hours a week as you will.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**STICK TO THIS SCHEDULE**, no matter when competition is. Extra time beyond the 6 weeks should be used for driver/pit practice.
{% endhint %}

## Before Build Season

* Make sure EVERYTHING is up to date (to the fullest extent possible, some tools won't be released until after kickoff)
  * Update firmware on EVERYTHING
    * [Update and/or program radio](specifics/radio-programming-and-flashing.md)
    * Motor controllers
    * PDP
    * Literally anything else that has firmware
  * Update software on laptops
    * FRC Game Tools
    * WPILib (VSCode will download itself with this)
    * Phoenix Tuner
    * REV Client
* Create a GitHub repository for the new bot
* Start programming anything you can, like the drivetrain
